• Rupee Cost Averaging: Buy more units when prices are low, fewer when high
• Power of Compounding: Earn returns on returns over time
• Disciplined Investing: Build wealth systematically without market timing
• Affordable: Start with as little as ₹500/month

Example: ₹5,000/month SIP for 20 years at 12% returns = ₹50 lakh investment becomes ₹1.5 crore!
